# cuti.tv - Vylet Pony radio
## (can be adapted for multiple in the future)

To run, it needs a MongoDB database. For your convenience, mongo-testdata has the Vylet Pony tracks, last updated 7/7/25.

.ENV should be like:

```
MONGODB_USERNAME=
MONGODB_PASSWORD=
DEVELOPMENT=true
PORT=3000
```

:3 enjoy!
